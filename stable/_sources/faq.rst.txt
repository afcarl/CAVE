F.A.Q.

.. rubric:: The automatic export of bokeh-plots does not work, why?

You're likely seeing a warning refering to missing installs of selenium and/or
phantomjs-prebuilt. While selenium should be included in the requirements,
phantomjs-prebuilt is not a pip-install. Please refer to the documentation of
phantomjs to see how installation works.
